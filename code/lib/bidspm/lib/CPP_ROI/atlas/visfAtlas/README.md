visfAtlas in nifti volume format

The visfAtlas is based on N19 subjects. In FreeSurfer, it is aligned to the
fsaverage brain. In BrainVoyager, it is aligned to a newly generated average
brain for BrainVoyager, called the BVaverage. The BVaverage is distributed with
this publication. The nifti volume atlas is aligned to the MNI colin27 brain.

Citing:

Please cite the article for use of the functional atlas as well as the
BVaverage.

Rosenke, M., van Hoof, R., van den Hurk, J., Goebel, R. (2020). A probabilistic
functional parcellation of human occipito-temporal cortex. TBD

To acknowledge using this atlas in your research, you might include a sentence
like one of the following:

"We used the functional atlas of visual cortex developed by Rosenke et al.
(2020)…”

The maximum probability map can be visualized by opening the
visfATlas_volume.nii.gz file and loading the correct color map
(visfAtlas_FSL.cmap) through the overlay display panel.
